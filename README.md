# Simple-TODO-WebApp
Just a small WebApp i created to incorporate some of the DOM manipulation i've been learning. Retrieves user input and creates dotted list elements (as you would obviously expect a TODO app to do) i also incorporated the enter key submitting the user entry aswell as the submit button itself.
